discord-terms
=============
These are the official discord terms of service, taken from the git repo [here](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/tree/62c9a95b56d2f989d3eefe39a058d69189f6b4a6/docs/policies_and_agreements).

This was done for a brief comparison to analyse the impact of this.

I still don't care enough to figure this out precicely, I'll just watch and see what happens.
