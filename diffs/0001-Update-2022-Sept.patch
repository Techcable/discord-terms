+## Posted date: September 1, 2022
 
-Throughout this document, we use the word **_“Terms”_** to refer to the terms below, terms within the accompanying API and SDK documentation, our [Discord Developer Policy](#DOCS_POLICIES_AND_AGREEMENTS_DEVELOPER_POLICY), and any applicable policies and guidelines. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict.

For a translated version in your selected language, as available, please see **[here](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/articles/8562894815383)**.*
+
+Welcome! Thank you for your interest in Discord’s APIs, software development kits (“SDKs”), and other developer products and services and associated software (including those described in or available via our [Developer Portal](#DOCS_INTRO)) (collectively, "APIs" or “Developer Platform”).
+
+These Developer Terms of Service (“Developer Terms”) apply to your access to and use of the APIs and set forth the legal obligations between us and you. 
+
+When we say “Discord,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these Developer Terms of Service, we mean Discord Inc., unless otherwise set forth in additional terms applicable to a given API.
+
+When we say “Terms” in these Developer Terms, we mean, collectively, these Developer Terms, our [Developer Documentation](#DOCS_INTRO) and any other applicable documentation we make available (“Documentation”), our [Discord Developer Policy](#DOCS_POLICIES_AND_AGREEMENTS_DEVELOPER_POLICY), our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) (including our [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)), and any other applicable terms, policies, and guidelines we make available (including in our [Developer Portal](#DOCS_INTRO) or [Help Center](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc)). If there is a conflict between these Developer Terms and any additional terms, then these Developer Terms will control for that conflict. If you use other Discord services in connection with the APIs, then the terms for those other services also apply to you. Additional defined terms are described in Section 13 (Definitions) below.
+
+**Important Note: Section 12(e) (Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution) incorporates the [dispute resolution provision](https://discord.com/terms#settling-disputes-between-you-and-discord) from our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), which includes an arbitration clause and class action waiver that applies to all U.S.-based Discord users. Please read this section carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.**

You are also agreeing that (i) you are 13 years of age and the minimum age of digital consent in your country, (ii) if you are the age of majority in your jurisdiction or over, that you have read, understood, and accept to be bound by the Terms, and (iii) if you are between 13 (or the minimum age of digital consent, as applicable) and the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these Terms. Please read all the Terms carefully. 
+By accepting these Developer Terms of Service, creating or operating an Application, or otherwise accessing or using our APIs, you agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. You also confirm and agree that (i) you are at least 13 years of age and meet the minimum age of digital consent in your country, and (ii) if you are not old enough to have authority to consent to the Terms in your country, that your parent or legal guardian must agree to the Terms on your behalf. If you are a parent or legal guardian, and your teenager accesses or uses the APIs, then the Terms also apply to you and you are responsible for your teenager’s activity. Please read all the Terms carefully.
 
-You may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the APIs.
+You may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if you are barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are a resident or from which you use the APIs.
 
 If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to that entity).
 
-## b. Registration
+## b. Registration & Application Information
 
-In order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the APIs. You must provide accurate and up-to-date registration information at all times. We will use the information you submit in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).
+You may be required or requested to provide certain information about yourself (such as identification or contact details or materials) and your Application (such as details about its functionality) as part of the registration process for access to the APIs (including when you create your Application), or as part of your continued use of the APIs (including in the Developer Portal or during App Review). You will ensure such information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date at all times. Without limiting the foregoing, you will maintain a clear and accurate description of your Application in its user-facing profiles. You will not misrepresent or mask your, or your Application’s, identity in the Developer Portal, as part of any registration process or App Review, or when using the APIs. We will use information about you to confirm your identity and as otherwise described in our [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).
 
-# Section 2: User Privacy and Security.
+# Section 2: Use of the APIs
 
-## a. Implement Good Privacy Practices.
+## a. License to you
 
-You will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personally identifiable information ("PII"). You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your application that uses the API (your “API Client”) that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with Discord and third parties.
+Subject to your compliance with the Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable license to access and use the APIs and Documentation we make available to you solely as necessary to integrate with, develop, and operate your Application to the extent permitted under the Terms (including the [Developer Policy](#DOCS_POLICIES_AND_AGREEMENTS_DEVELOPER_POLICY)). We reserve all rights, title, and interest not expressly granted in the Terms and you may not access or use the APIs or Documentation except as set forth in the Terms.
 
-## b. Implement Good Security. 
+## b. Restrictions
 
-You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect data collected by your API Client, including PII, from unauthorized access or use. These efforts will include, but are not limited to, encryption of this data at rest. You will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.
+You will not (and will not attempt to or permit or enable others to): (a) reverse engineer or otherwise derive source code, trade secrets, or know-how from the APIs, except to the extent this restriction is prohibited by applicable laws; (b) modify, create derivative works, copy, reproduce, redistribute, rent, lease, sell, or syndicate access to the APIs; or (c) access or use the APIs in any way that (i) is not in accordance with the applicable Documentation, (ii) compromises, breaks, or circumvents any of our technical processes or security measures, (iii) poses a security vulnerability to users, us (including our systems or networks), or any third party, or (iv) exceeds any API rate, call, or other usage limits we set in our sole discretion (including as set forth in the Developer Policy or the applicable Documentation) or that we believe constitutes excessive or abusive usage.
 
-# Section 3: API Clients and Monitoring
+## c. Open Source Software
 
-The APIs are designed to help you enhance your API Client. You agree to respond promptly to our requests to verify and audit your compliance with these Terms. YOU AGREE THAT DISCORD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE DISCORD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include Discord accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect Discord or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Discord may use any technical means to overcome such interference. 
+Some of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license, as may be listed in the Documentation. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with Discord solely for the applicable open source software.
 
-# Section 4: IP, DMCA, and Confidentiality
+## d. Developer Credentials
 
-## a. IP Ownership, Open Source, and Feedback 
+You will use any developer credentials (such as your Application ID, passwords, keys, tokens, and client secrets) we assign to you solely with your Application and the applicable APIs (and will not permit or enable any other Application to use them) and will treat them as Discord confidential information (as described below). Without limiting the foregoing, you will keep API keys and tokens encrypted in any files or other materials accessible by third parties (other than your Service Providers, subject to Section 12(a)). For the avoidance of doubt, developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.
 
-Discord does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs.
+## e. Eligibility
 
-Some of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with Discord for the applicable open source software.
+As part of the APIs, we may make certain features available to you that require you to meet additional criteria in order to be eligible to access them (e.g., to enable your Application to be discoverable on or through Discord services). For the avoidance of doubt, your access to and use of such features will be subject to your compliance with the then-current applicable eligibility criteria and other policies (in addition to all other Terms). 
 
-If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.
+# Section 3: Use of App Content and Your Application
 
-## b. Discord DMCA Policy
+## a. License
 
-We can't determine whether something is being used legally or not without copyright holder’s input. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Discord's policy about responding to notices in our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
+You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to run, publicly display and perform, distribute, reproduce, modify, host, translate, store, and otherwise use your Application and App Content in connection with operating, developing, and improving the APIs and other Discord services; provided that the right to reproduce does not apply to the Application. This license is to allow us to, among other things: enable users to install and use your Application in Discord servers; display and provide information about you (including your name and Brand Features) and your Application to users (including in profile and product pages); frame and link to, place content around, and limit commands from your Application; make your Application discoverable by users on or through Discord services (including in search results, categories, and collections with other Applications); attribute you as the source of App Content; and analyze your Application and App Content for performance and compliance. For clarity, the things we do under this license will depend in part on your Application, App Content, and how you use the APIs. For example, if your Application is a bot integration that you host and deploy on your own, then we would not need to host your Application. This license will remain in effect with respect to App Content after the Terms end. We will not be subject to any terms or policies associated with your Application or App Content (even if we click to agree). 
 
-## c. Confidential Matters
+## b. Users
+
+You are solely responsible for your Application (including its development, operation, maintenance, support, distribution, use, and content). You will require users to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Terms (including our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)) in connection with their use of your Application (and will not permit or enable them to violate any of the foregoing). If you have a separate terms of service or other agreement to apply to users’ use of your Application, you agree (i) such agreement is solely between you and the user and we will not have any responsibility or liability thereunder and (ii) such agreement may not and will not supersede, modify, or be inconsistent with the Terms, which will supersede if there is any conflict or inconsistency with your agreement.
+
+# Section 4: Compliance with Laws & Third-Party Rights
+
+You and your Application will (and you will require those acting on your behalf and your users to): (i) comply with all applicable laws and regulations; (ii) not infringe or violate any third-party rights (including intellectual or other proprietary rights or rights of privacy or publicity); (iii) not access or use the APIs in a manner that is deceptive, unethical, false, misleading, or encourages or promotes illegal activity or infringement or violation of third-party rights; and (iv) not violate any other terms or policies with Discord.
+
+You represent and warrant that you have obtained and will maintain all necessary rights (including from your users) to grant us the licenses, permissions, and other rights in the Terms (including those in Sections 3(a) and 8(d)) and to operate your Application (including to display, distribute, and provide all information, data, and other content therein).
+
+# Section 5: User Privacy and Security
+
+## a. Implement Good Privacy Practices
+
+Without limiting Section 4, you will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your Application that is compliant with applicable privacy laws and clearly, accurately, and fully describes to users of your Application what data you collect, how you use and share such data with us and third parties, and how users can request deletion of such data. For the avoidance of doubt, how you use data includes how you access, collect, store, retain, transmit, share, and otherwise process it. You may only use API Data in accordance with your privacy policy, applicable laws and regulations, and the Terms. You agree that your privacy policy may not and will not supersede, modify, or be inconsistent with the Terms, which will supersede if there is any conflict or inconsistency with your privacy policy. You will maintain publicly available, up-to-date links to your privacy policy in the Developer Portal.
+
+## b. API Data Sharing & Retention
+
+You will not share API Data with any third party, except in the following circumstances, subject to compliance with the Terms and applicable laws and regulations: (i) with a Service Provider; (ii) to the extent required under applicable laws or regulations; and (iii) when a user of your Application expressly directs you to share their API Data with the third party (and you will provide us proof thereof upon request). 
+
+Except to the extent you are required to retain API Data under applicable laws or regulations, you will (1) promptly update the API Data upon request from us or the applicable user, and (2) promptly delete the API Data when: (a) retaining it is no longer necessary for your Application’s stated (and approved through App Review, as applicable) functionality that is permitted under the Terms; (b) you stop operating your Application (whether on your own, due to an enforcement action by us, or otherwise); (c) we request you delete it; (d) the applicable user requests you delete it; or (e) required by applicable laws or regulations. You will give users an easily accessible way to ask for their API Data to be modified and deleted. If you have received API Data in error, you will immediately tell us, delete it, and provide proof of deletion upon our request.
+
+## c. Implement Good Security
+
+You will, and will require those acting on your behalf to, use commercially reasonable efforts to protect API Data from unauthorized access or use (including, for the avoidance of doubt, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, distribution, or other compromise). These efforts will include: (i) encryption of the data at rest and (ii) maintaining administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that are designed to prevent unauthorized access and use and comply with applicable laws and regulations (including relating to data security and privacy). You will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of their data to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations. You will also promptly notify us and provide us with requested information about any incidents of unauthorized access or use of any API Data or any incidents that are reasonably likely to compromise the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your systems (or the systems of those acting on your behalf) that process API Data. In the event of any of the foregoing incidents, you will immediately begin to remediate it and reasonably cooperate with us, including by keeping us regularly updated about the incident and its impact on API Data, remediation actions being taken, and your compliance with any notification or other requirements under applicable laws and regulations.
 
-1. Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client secrets) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.
-2. Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Discord confidential information. Discord confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not disclose it to any third party without Discord's prior written consent unless required by law with reasonable prior notice to us (unless a court orders that we not receive notice).
+# Section 6: Monitoring & App Review
 
-# Section 5: Content
+The APIs are designed to help you enhance your Application. You agree to respond promptly to our requests to verify and audit your compliance with these Terms. YOU AGREE THAT DISCORD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE DISCORD APIs AND OTHER SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Discord may use any technical means to overcome such interference.
 
-## a. Content Accessible Through our APIs
+Without limiting the foregoing, we may also require that you submit your Application for our review and approval in various circumstances (e.g., to approve access to certain APIs or API Data, when use of your Application reaches certain thresholds, or to review compliance with the Terms) (“App Review”). You will cooperate with App Review and provide and maintain accurate and complete information as we request (including in the Developer Portal). If your Application has been approved through App Review, you will not materially change your Application’s functionality (including the scope of API Data you collect or how you use or share it) beyond its reviewed stated purpose, unless you first re-submit your Application, and receive our approval, through App Review.
 
-Our APIs contain some third-party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available and you are solely responsible for your decision to use or distribute any of this content. While we may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content, we make no representations or warranties about the content, its appropriateness, legality, pedigree or other details. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.
+Periodically, we may also request (including through the Developer Portal) information, certifications, and attestations relating to your access to or use of the APIs or API Data, which you will provide to us in the requested time frame and form and which you will ensure are accurate and complete. If you are an entity, such certifications and attestations must be provided by an authorized representative.
 
-## b. Submission of Content
+# Section 7: IP and Confidentiality
 
-Some of our APIs allow the submission of content. Discord does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in these Terms. For the sole purpose of enabling Discord to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and only in accordance with the applicable Discord privacy policies, you give Discord a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to Use content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. **_"Use"_** means use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.
+## a. IP Ownership and Feedback
 
-# Section 6: Brand Features; Attribution
+Discord does not acquire ownership in your Application, and you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs, API Data, Documentation, or Discord confidential information or any derivative works of any of the foregoing.
+
+Our APIs and API Data contain some third-party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available and you are solely responsible for your decision to use or distribute any of this content. While we may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms and we may remove or refuse to display content, we make no representations or warranties about the content or any decisions we make regarding it. Finally, API Data may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that API Data or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the API Data may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.
+
+If you provide suggestions or other feedback about our APIs, Documentation, or any other Discord services, then you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, transferable license to use the feedback and ideas generated from the feedback without any restrictions, attribution, or compensation to you.
+
+## b. Discord Copyright and IP Policy
+
+We respond to notices of alleged IP infringement and terminate the accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and [Discord’s Copyright & IP Policy](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410339349655-Discord-s-Copyright-IP-Policy). If you think somebody is violating your IP and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices in the foregoing policy.
+
+## c. Confidential Matters
+
+Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Discord confidential information. Discord confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked or designated confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances (including any nonpublic information). Without limiting the foregoing, your participation in any research or feedback surveys or sessions or in any experimentation, testing, or use of APIs we make available to you that are not generally publicly available (including any information you receive, and feedback you provide us, in connection therewith) are Discord confidential information. If you receive any Discord confidential information, then you (i) will keep it confidential using no less than reasonable care to protect it and will only use it as necessary for your permitted use of the applicable APIs under the Terms and to provide us feedback, and (ii) will not disclose it to any third party without Discord's prior written consent, except to the extent (1) required by law with reasonable prior notice to us unless prohibited by court order or (2) necessary for a Service Provider to provide you services subject to Section 12(a).

For the avoidance of doubt, Service Providers are acting on your behalf. You will ensure that each Service Provider complies with the Terms as if they are in your place, and you are solely responsible and liable for their acts and omissions, including noncompliance. When you stop using a Service Provider, you will ensure they immediately cease using the APIs and API Data and promptly delete all API Data in their possession or control. Upon notice, we may prohibit your use of any Service Provider if we reasonably believe that they have violated the Terms or they are negatively impacting us, the APIs or our other services, API Data, or the users, and you will promptly stop using them.

+## e. Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution
 
-Except as set forth below the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the APIs.
+Subject to Section 11 above with respect to the governing law that applies to EEA Data Transfers, the [“Settling disputes between you and Discord” section in our Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms#settling-disputes-between-you-and-discord) applies, where references to “the services” or “our services” will mean the APIs, “these terms” will mean these Developer Terms of Service, and the date for emailing an opt-out notice is within 30 days of October 1, 2022 or when you first create an Application, whichever is later.

If you do not comply with the Terms, and Discord does not take action right away, this does not mean that Discord is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and Discord relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject.

+Discord is a place of belonging where developers come to build cool tools to further the way that people connect. As Discord continues to grow and support our developers, it’s important to be transparent about the responsibilities and expectations of our developers and their Applications. This document sets forth the policies developers will need to follow to develop and operate their Applications.
 
-- modify a Discord user’s account without explicit permission from the Discord user. For example, you may not add a Discord user to a Discord (also known as a “server”) unless that Discord user expressly approved joining that Discord (such as when using a "group finder" app);
-- post messages, trigger notifications, or play audio on behalf of a Discord user except in response to such Discord user expressly opting-in to each instance of such action;
-- obtain Discord passwords or credentials under any circumstance; or
-- target users with advertisements or marketing.
+## Introduction
 
-## Handle data with care. 
+This Discord Developer Policy is incorporated into the [Discord Developer Terms of Service](#DOCS_POLICIES_AND_AGREEMENTS_TERMS_OF_SERVICE) (“Developer Terms”) and you agree that it applies to your access to and use of our APIs in addition to the Developer Terms and other Terms. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein (including API Data and Application) have the meaning assigned to them in the Developer Terms. For clarity, the term “including” as used herein means “including without limitation.”
 
-You may not use the APIs in any way to:
+Please check back here regularly as we may update these policies from time to time and your continued access to or use of the APIs after such updates go into effect means you accept and agree to them. Additional terms and policies may also apply to your access to or use of certain APIs (including as described in or available via our [Developer Portal](#DOCS_INTRO) or [Help Center](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/categories/360000656491)).
 
-- scrape any Discord Data;
-- use Discord Data for any purpose other than as necessary to provide your application;
-- disclose any user’s Discord Data without their specific, informed consent; 
-- disclose Discord Data to any ad network, data broker, or other advertising or monetization related service; 
-- retain data any longer than necessary for the operation of your application;
-- contravene Discord’s Privacy Policy;
-- obtain Discord User passwords to obtain access to Discord Data; 
-- sell, license or otherwise commercialize any Discord Data; 
-- provide or direct services to children under the age of thirteen (13) in the United States or, outside of the United States, the relevant age of digital consent; 
-- process Discord Data in a way that surprises or violates Discord users’ expectations.
+## Protect Discord users
 
-## Don’t Do Anything Illegal, Harmful, or Otherwise Not Cool.
+- **Do not modify a Discord user’s account without explicit permission from the Discord user**. Functionality that intends to make any changes to a Discord account, for example adding the account to a server, must clearly and properly inform the Discord account owner of the changes and receive explicit permission to enact the changes. 
+- **Do not collect, solicit, or deceive users into providing user login credentials**. Under no circumstances may you or your Application solicit, obtain, or request login credentials from Discord users in any way. This includes information such as passwords or user access or login tokens.
+- **Do not target users with advertisements or marketing**. Messaging to Discord users from any Application or developer team should be relevant to the function of the Application and may not contain material unrelated to an Application’s function or information.
 
-You may not use the APIs in any way:
+## Handle data with care
 
-- to promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling;
-- for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems);
-- that doesn’t comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and third party rights;
-- to encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights;
-- to use the APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State
-- to distribute NSFW material without an NSFW tag; or
-- to defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten others, or otherwise violate our [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
+- **Do not use API Data for any purpose outside of what is necessary to provide your stated functionality**. You may not request, access, or use any API Data for any purpose other than as necessary to provide your Application’s stated (and approved through App Review, as applicable) functionality; provided that you may also use API Data for the purpose of improving your Application only if it has been aggregated or de-identified such that it cannot be associated with, or used to identify, any individual.
+- **You may not mine or scrape any data, content, or information available on or through Discord services (as defined in our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)).**
+- **Do not use API Data to:** profile Discord users, their identities, or relationships with other users; to discriminate against anyone based on personal or protected classifications as defined in our [Community Guidelines](https://dis.gd/guidelines); or for eligibility considerations for benefits or for purposes such as employment, housing, insurance, or otherwise.
+  - Furthermore, you may not, and may not use your Application, to obtain API Data or transmit data to Discord (i) of persons under the age of 13 or the relevant age of digital consent in their jurisdiction (if older) or (ii) that includes protected health information, financial information, or other sensitive information under applicable law, except to the extent specifically allowed by our terms for a given Discord service or necessary to process a financial transaction as specifically enabled by a Discord service;
+- **Do not disclose API data to any advertising network, data broker, or other advertising or monetization related service.**
+- **Do not sell, license, or otherwise commercialize any API Data or Discord services (as defined in our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), e.g., Nitro subscriptions). **
+- **Do not direct your Application to people who are under the age of 13 or the minimum age of digital consent in their applicable countries**. Our services are only for people who are at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age of digital consent in their applicable countries.
+- **Do not attempt to re-identify, de-anonymize, unscramble, unencrypt, or reverse hash or reverse engineer API Data from the form in which you obtain it.**
+- **Do not use API Data in any way that goes against Discord users’ expectations**. This includes frequently sending unsolicited direct messages, sending direct messages not directly related to maintaining or improving an Application's core functionality, or making unsolicited changes to user data or to a user’s access to Discord services. 
 
-## Don’t abuse the platform. 
+For the avoidance of doubt, the above policies apply in addition to the terms relating to API Data described in the Developer Terms (including Section 5 (User Privacy and Security)), and use of data includes how you access, collect, store, retain, transmit, share, and otherwise process it.
 
-You will:
+## Apps Should Provide a Positive, Quality Experience
 
-- require your end users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable law, regulation, and the Discord Terms of Service; and
-- only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. 
+- **Do not use the API for any dangerous or illegal activity.** This includes, but is not limited to, activities that facilitate or promote:
+  - Death, bodily harm, and/or personal injury;
+  - Environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control); or
+  - Unlawful online gambling.
+- **Do not use the APIs in any way to violate, or to enable or promote others to violate, the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://dis.gd/guidelines)**. As described in the Developer Terms, you are responsible for ensuring that your Application is not used to violate any of the Terms. We take into consideration the abundance, explicit negligence, and intentional enabling of violating behavior when assessing appropriate enforcement. Prohibited behaviors and activities include those that:
+  - Defraud users;
+  - Deceive users via impersonation (outside of clearly labeled satire, parody, or fan accounts), including impersonating other Applications, Discord employees or partners, or Discord services. This includes deception via your and your Application’s account and identity;
+  - Distribute adult content to users under the age of 18, and without age-restricted labels where applicable and appropriate to users 18 and older;
+    - Unless your Application is labeled as age-restricted, you will make sure your Application is appropriate for users under the age of eighteen (18) and complies with all applicable laws (including those applicable to users under the age of eighteen (18)).
+  - Or enable, promote, or organize any on or off-platform harassment.
+- **Do not promote offensive, vulgar, violent, or violent extremist content, messages, or images**. This includes the fields in an Application’s Settings page in the Discord Developer Portal.
+- **Do not attempt to manipulate engagement**. You may not participate, enable, or promote the inflating of server membership with bot or user accounts or mass creation of user accounts to redeem rewards or send messages. You may not automate messages to be sent for the purpose of maintaining message activity in a Discord community.
+- **Do not contact users outside of Discord without their explicit consent**. This means you should not contact Discord users outside of the Discord platform by using any API Data (including any data obtained, disclosed, or inferred through a user’s use of your Application).
+- **Do not enable your developer team, Application, or other users to bypass or circumvent Discord’s privacy, safety, and security measures**. Your Application must respect user-initiated blocks, bans, kicks, mutes, visibility settings (such as users opting out of displaying connections or permission settings), and must not enable any form of masking account identities (such as obscuring Discord usernames).
 
-You will not:
+## Respect the Platform
 
-- remove, obscure, or alter Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or any links to or notices of those terms;
-- encourage or create functionality for your users that violates Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms);
-- sublicense an API for use by a third party;
-- create an application that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties;
-- perform an action with the intent of introducing to Discord products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature; 
-- reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law;

+- **Obtain consent before initiating processes on a user or server’s behalf**. Your Application must respect user decisions to opt out of or block the Application, as applicable. On the server level, your Application must respect server members’ (with the appropriate permissions) ability to remove the Application. The manner of providing the option for consent/authentication must be clearly labeled and apparent, and contain an accurate description of the purpose or feature being enabled. For example, if your Application is providing a service in response to a user initiated request or command, this is an acceptable instance of consent here. 
+- **Use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly make yourself or your team available for feedback or user support regarding your Application.**
+- **Notify Discord and affected users of potential unauthorized access to API Data, as described in Section 5 of the Developer Terms.**
+- **Do not remove, obscure, or alter Discord’s links to any of the Terms.**

If you are (or become) a "covered entity" or "business associate" as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the APIs for any purpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information to Discord.
